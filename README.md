### Responsive Design Decisions
- Flexbox & Grid Layouts for adaptive product listing and cart display.
- Media Queries to adjust layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Mobile-first approach:
    Simplified navigation and stacked layout on small screens
    Product items collapse into vertical cards for readability.
- Desktop view:
- Side-by-side product list and cart for efficient use of space
